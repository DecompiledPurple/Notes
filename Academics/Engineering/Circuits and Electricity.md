## Terminology
### Current => $I$
 Measured in Amps; an Ampere $A$.
- The Movement of electrons along a path per unit of time. 

### Voltage => $V|E$
Measured in Volts; a Volt $V$.
-  The opposition that a device or material offer to the flow or direct current.
-  The loss of potential electrical energy when passing through a resistor can be called voltage drop, voltage across the resistor, or voltage over the resistor.

### Resistance => $R$
Measured in Ohms; an Ohm $\Omega$. 
- The amount of work to be done to move a charge from one point to another along an electric circuit.
- Conductors have very low resistance, while insulators have high resistance.
