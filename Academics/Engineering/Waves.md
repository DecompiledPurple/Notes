## Terminology

### Amplitude =>$A$
 - The length between the starting point and max displacement.

### Frequency => $f$
Measured in $\frac{Events}{Time}$ often Hertz (undefined) => $Hz$
- How many waves pass a point. Number of events per unit of time.
- The reciprocal of period: $f = \frac{1}{T}$

### Period => $T$
Measured in $\frac{Time}{Event}$ often seconds
- Time it takes to complete an oscillation. Time per event.
- The reciprocal of frequency: $T = \frac{1}{f}$

### Wavelength => $\lambda$
- The distance between adjacent identical parts of the wave, parallel to the direction of propagation. 

### Wave Velocity => $V_{w}$
- The speed at which the disturbance moves.
