## 5.3 Industrial revolution

Defined:
- The process by which states transition from agrarian economies to industrial economy.
	- Moving from hand work to machine made products

- Started in GB ^a127b5
	- Proximity to waterways => Efficient and rapid transportation to various markets.
	- Geographical distribution of coal and iron
		- Increase efficiency in production of iron to build bridges and stuff
	- Made a maritime empire => Large access of resources

Factory System
- Place where goods for sale was mass produced by machines
- Spinning Jenny produced textiles
- => Specialization of labor. Workers were now interchangeable cogs; easily replaceable.

## 5.4 The Spread of Industrial Revolution

### The Start
- Steam Engine
	- Converted fossil fuel into mechanical energy
		- Coal was better than water powered, as it could be used anywhere
	- => Steamships

### World Economies

What explains the difference between quick adopters of industrialization and slow adopters?
The speed at which they attained the resources to match [[AP World History#^a127b5|Great Britain's conditions.]]

 - Lacked abundant coal deposits
 - Landlocked from waterways
 - Controlled by other states
	=> Split industrialized nations vs unindustrialized nations
		
Egypt and India
- Both had shipbuilding sectors
- Britain later controlled it, but now GB stopped buying

France began to adopt industrial technology
- Lacked coal and iron deposits after Napoleon was outed
- Gov sponsored railroads
- France industrialized slower but France was spared social upheaval

United States
- Industrialized fast
	- Political stability postwar
	- Massive territory
	- Massive market of people
Russia
- Railroads and Steam Engines adopted
	- Trans Siberian Railroad
- Brutal conditions for workers
	- Uprisings and Russian revolutions
- **Unlike America, whose industrialization was driven by workers seeking opportunities, Russia's was state-driven due to their lagging development compared to Western Europe**

Japan
- Many Asians states were declining in power
	- China was being knocked around by Western powers
	- Japan didn't want this
	- => defensive industrialization, burrowing western techniques
		- Became one of the strongest nations in the region

## 5.5 Technologies

### The two revolutions

| First Industrial Revolution | Second Industrial Revolution |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1750-1850                   | 1870-1914                    |
| Great Britain               | Europe, US, Japan            |
| Coal                        | Oil                          |
- Coal by James Watt
	- Attached to factory machines cranked up power
	- Way better than water, due to location and energy 
	- => Steam Engines
		- => Locomotive
		- => Steam boat
- Oil
	- => Internal combustion engine
		- => Automobile

**Both dramatically increased energy available to humans, despite the environmental factors.**

### Effects of new technology
